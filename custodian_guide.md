# Co-Engineer Protocol – Studio Custodian Guide

*A Living Playbook for Building Studios in the Co-Engineer Ecosystem*

---

## 🌱 What This Repository Is

This repository contains the **Studio Custodian Guide**, the foundational framework for building, operating, and scaling venture studios using the **Co-Engineer Protocol**.

It is designed for **Studio Custodians** — learner-builders who transform structured protocols into real, functioning studios using AI, automation, and modular systems.

If you're here, you're not just reading documentation — you're entering a **builder ecosystem**.

## 🧭 Core Role: Studio Custodian

**Role ID:** `ROLE_001`

A Studio Custodian is an **operational learner-builder** who:
- Learns from the **Co-Engineer Protocol Lab Studio**
- Applies the **Co-Engineer Protocol Kit**
- Builds **Co-engineered Studios**
- Evolves with **Co-engineer AI** (Chat → Automation → Agentic)
- Maintains a **Studio Thesis** (Technical + Economic models)

You sit at the intersection of:
```
Protocol Knowledge → AI Systems → Studio Execution → Ecosystem Growth
```

## 🏗 Ecosystem Structure

```
CO-ENGINEER ECOSYSTEM
├── Protocol Lab Studio (Training)
├── Protocol Kit (Tools)
├── Co-engineer AI (Intelligence Layer)
├── Studio Custodians (Builders)
└── Co-engineered Studios (Ventures)
```

Example Studios:
- **Mushroom Studio** – Climate Smart Zero Waste Agriculture
- **NewNext Studio** – Venture Infrastructure Platform

---

## 🧰 Protocol Kit Structure

```
PROTOCOL_KIT/
├── 1_MANUAL/          → Learning material
├── 2_WORKSHEETS/      → Execution templates
├── 3_CORE_TECH_MODULES/ → Technical systems
├── 4_OPEN_SOURCE_MODEL/ → Contribution layer
```

This structure enables:
- Standardization
- Replication
- Scaling
- Automation
- Collaboration

---

## 📈 Learning Path

### Phase 1 – Custodian
- Learn protocol
- Use AI in Chat mode
- Build first studio
- Maintain Studio Thesis

### Phase 2 – Aspiring Builder
- Automation systems
- SDK integrations
- Multi-studio development
- Network collaboration

### Phase 3 – Builder Professional
- Client studios
- Agentic AI systems
- Protocol contributions
- Ecosystem leadership

---

## 🔁 Intelligence & Data Flow

```
Google Drive RAG → Co-engineer AI → Studio Execution → Studio Thesis → Protocol Evolution
```

This creates a **learning loop**:
> Build → Learn → Document → Improve → Scale

---

## 🧠 Three Custodianship Domains

### Technical Custodianship
- AI integration
- Sensors & data systems
- Protocol compliance
- Automation pipelines

### Economic Custodianship
- Unit economics
- Value creation
- Growth systems
- Financial models

### Operational Custodianship
- Weekly execution
- Documentation
- Learning systems
- Studio management

---

## 📅 Execution Rhythm

**Weekly**
- Learn → Build → Document → Improve

**Monthly**
- Analyze performance
- Ecosystem connection
- Protocol updates
- Studio expansion

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- Studios built
- Protocol modules completed
- AI capability progression
- Economic viability
- System reliability
- Protocol contributions

---

## 🌍 Builder Network Path

Custodian → Aspiring Builder → Builder Professional

This path leads to:
- Client studios
- Venture systems
- AI-powered platforms
- Protocol leadership

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

This is not a static framework.

This is a **living system**.

Every studio built improves the protocol.
Every failure strengthens the system.
Every contribution compounds ecosystem intelligence.

```
You Learn → You Build → You Contribute → The Protocol Improves → Everyone Wins
```
