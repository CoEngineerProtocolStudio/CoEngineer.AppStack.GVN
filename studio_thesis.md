## 4. Studio Custodian (Key Role)

The **Studio Custodian** is the person who keeps the Studio Thesis clean and useful.

### Job

Make and maintain the studio compound.

### Responsibilities

- organize and clean studio documents

Too much information creates bad decisions.

The Studio Thesis should contain **only what helps action**.
The Studio Custodian protects this clarity.

A Studio Custodian maintains this playbook by cleaning information, updating workflows, running regular review rituals, and protecting clarity.
